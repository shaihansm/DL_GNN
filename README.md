# DL_GNN

This repository contains code and experiments related to **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** using Deep Learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to explore GNN architectures and their applications on graph-structured data.

## Project Overview

Graph Neural Networks are a powerful class of models that operate on graph data structures. This notebook (`DL_GNN.ipynb`) covers:

- Graph data preprocessing
- GNN model architectures (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)
- Training and evaluation pipelines
